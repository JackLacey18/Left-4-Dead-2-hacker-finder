### Left-4-Dead-2-hacker-finder

This script checks the console log of Left 4 Dead 2 for players that are possible cheaters
and prints the results to the user.

-condebug must be enabled in the launch options (click properties on the Left 4 Dead 2 file on steam)

Using the console type 'status', this will send all player IDs into the log for the script to parse.

If any suspected cheaters are found the result will be printed in the command line.
