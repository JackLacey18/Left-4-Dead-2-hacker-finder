This will create the console.log file that can be parsed. The log will be located in a path similar to below.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\console.log"

Using the console in-game type 'status', this will send all player IDs into the log for the script to parse.

If any suspected cheaters are found the result will be printed in the command line.
